# Neural Network From Scratch

The base code and inspiration is from YouTube: [Neural Network from Scratch | Mathematics & Python Code](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ4osgQ7WN6PGnvt6tzLAVAEMsL3LBqpm).

# Edits
Added docstrings
Fixed MNIST imports
Converted to object oriented approach
Added save and load functionality
CNN code does not work currently, only the neural network does. See mnist.py for example codes. Use mnist.json for a 91% accuracy on the MNIST database
